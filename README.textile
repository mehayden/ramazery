# Enhanced Tenjin Template Adapter

h2. Enhanced Tenjin Template Adapter

The currently shipped adapter for Tenjin does not support the features provided by the Tenjin::ContextHelper module including the use of nested templates.
This is because it uses the current action.binding and renders with code pulled from the Tenjin base.

The enhanced adapter uses a Tenjin::Engine hooked to a Tenjin::Context which is extended with the action instance variables and helpers. It uses the standard Tenjin render function which makes use of these objects.

Controller traits of :tenjin_options (Hash) and :tenjin_helpers (Array of Symbols) can be used to customize the behavior of the adapter. See Tenjin::Template #options and #extend_with_helpers for details.
